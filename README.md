users to explore the surrounding areas by dragging and zooming on the map and fetches Wikipedia 
articles related to the selected location, providing an interactive way for users to learn about the history and culture 
of a specific location. The website is responsive and  works seamlessly across different devices, making it an 
ideal tool for users who want to learn more about the significance of a location.
